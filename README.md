# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms<br>

Welcome to learning Data Structures and Algorithms!<br>

Data Structures are broadly divided into two categories: <br>
* Linear Data Structures
* Non-linear Data Structures<br>

# Contribution Guidelines<br>

* Anyone is free to contribute to this repository.<br>
* You can submit your DSA-related code in the respective language folders (i.e. C, C++, Java, Python etc.),
as this will help to maintain code effectively.<br>
* If you don't see the language you are comfortable with for creating a new file, fork this repository to add a folder in your fork, add
your code file, and then submit a pull request.
