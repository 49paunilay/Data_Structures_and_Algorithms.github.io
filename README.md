# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms

Welcome to learning Data Structures and Algorithms!

Data Structures are broadly divided into two categories: 
Linear Data Structures
Non-linear Data Structures

# Contribution Guidelines

Anyone is free to contribute to this repository. You can submit your DSA-related code in the respective language folders (i.e. C, C++, Java, Python etc.),
as this will help to maintain code effectively. If you don't see the language you are comfortable with for creating a new file, fork this repository to add a folder in your fork, add
your code file, and then submit a pull request.
